# mod-dungeon-master

A procedural dungeon challenge system for **AzerothCore** (WotLK 3.3.5a).

Players talk to a Dungeon Master NPC, pick a difficulty, creature theme, and dungeon — then get teleported into a cleared instance repopulated with level-scaled themed enemies and a boss. Kill everything to earn rewards. Roguelike mode chains dungeons together with escalating difficulty, affixes, and stacking stat buffs until the party wipes.

> ⚠️ **Early development** — expect bugs and rough edges. Bug reports welcome via Issues.

## Features

### Core System
- **37 dungeons** — Classic, TBC, and WotLK 5-man instances
- **9 creature themes** — Beast Hunt, Dragon's Lair, Demonic Invasion, Elemental Chaos, Giant's Keep, Undead Rising, Humanoid Stronghold, Mechanical Mayhem, Random Chaos
- **6 difficulty tiers** — Novice through Grandmaster with tuned HP/damage/reward multipliers
- **Level scaling** — Scale creatures to your party's level or use the tier's natural range
- **Any dungeon, any level** — A level 80 can run Deadmines scaled to 80, or at its original difficulty
- **Real dungeon bosses** — Final bosses are pulled from a global pool of all dungeon bosses across Classic, TBC, and WotLK instances, matched to the session's theme.
- **Party support** — Solo or groups up to 5
- **Group Loot support** — Items dropped by enemies support the Group Loot game mechanic where party members roll Need or Greed on qualifying items
- **Per-player difficulty** — HP and damage scale with party size; solo players get a reduction
- **Auto-resurrect** — Dead players revive at the entrance when combat ends
- **Environmental damage scaling** — Native dungeon hazards are scaled down for level-mismatched parties, hard-capped at 3% max HP per tick
- **Cooldown system** — Configurable per-character cooldown between runs
- **Persistent stats** — Tracks runs, kills, deaths, fastest clear times per character
- **Statistics & Leaderboards** — Separate tracking for normal runs and roguelike mode. Normal stats track win rate, kills, deaths, K/D ratio, and fastest clear. Roguelike stats track highest tier, most floors, total floors cleared, and longest run. Leaderboards include Normal Fastest Clears, Roguelike Highest Tier, and Roguelike Most Floors — with your own entries highlighted
- **GM commands** — `.dm reload`, `.dm status`, `.dm list`, `.dm end`, `.dm clearcooldown`

### Roguelike Mode
- **Infinite progression** — Clear a dungeon, get teleported to the next one, repeat until you wipe
- **Escalating difficulty** — Enemy HP and damage scale per tier (linear, then exponential)
- **Stacking stat buff** — +10% all stats per dungeon cleared (Blessing of Kings aura, reapplied on death)
- **Mythic+ style affixes** — Fortified, Tyrannical, Raging, Bolstering, Savage; layered at configurable tier thresholds
- **Random dungeon rotation** — Each floor picks a new dungeon appropriate for your level band
- **Tier-scaled rewards** — Better loot at higher tiers, with increasing epic drop chance
- **Dungeon Provisioner** — Sell items, repair gear and buy ammo/reagents at the start of each floor

## How It Works

### Standard Mode

1. Talk to the Dungeon Master NPC
2. Choose **difficulty tier** (Novice → Grandmaster)
3. Choose **scaling mode**:
   - **Scale to Party** — creatures match your group's average level
   - **Use Dungeon Difficulty** — creatures stay at the tier's natural level range
4. Choose **creature theme** (Undead, Demons, Beasts, etc.)
5. Choose **dungeon**
6. Confirm → teleport in → kill everything → collect rewards → teleport out

### Roguelike Mode

1. Talk to the NPC → select **Roguelike Challenge**
2. Choose difficulty, scaling, and theme (or random theme each floor)
3. Clear floor 1 → earn +10% all stats buff → auto-transition to floor 2
4. Enemies get harder each tier; affixes kick in at tier 3+
5. Keep going until you wipe — highest tier reached, floors cleared, and kills are saved to the roguelike leaderboard (separate from normal runs)

### Level Scaling

Creatures are force-scaled to the session's target level regardless of their original template. A level 80 Icecrown ghoul becomes a proper level 14 mob with correct HP, damage, armor, and nameplate display.

- **Effective Level** = party average (Scale to Party) or tier midpoint (Use Dungeon Difficulty)
- **Level Band** = EffectiveLevel ± `LevelBand` (default ±3), clamped to the tier's range
- Stats are recalculated from `creature_classlevelstats` for the target level

## Roguelike Affixes

Affixes are Mythic+ style modifiers applied at higher tiers:

| Affix | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| **Fortified** | Trash mobs: +30% HP, +15% damage |
| **Tyrannical** | Bosses: +40% HP, +20% damage |
| **Raging** | All enemies: +25% damage |
| **Bolstering** | All enemies: +20% HP |
| **Savage** | Double elite spawn chance |

Affixes stack — at tier 10+ you might face Fortified + Tyrannical + Raging simultaneously.

## GM Commands

| Command | Access | Description |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| `.dm status` | GM | Show module status and active session count |
| `.dm list` | GM | List all active sessions with details |
| `.dm end [id]` | Admin | Force-end a session (defaults to your own) |
| `.dm clearcooldown` | GM | Clear cooldown for target's whole group |
| `.dm reload` | Admin | Hot-reload configuration |

## Technical Notes

- **AzerothCore compatibility** — Built against the official [AzerothCore](https://github.com/azerothcore/azerothcore-wotlk) repository. No core modifications required.
- **Thread safety** — Session maps and cooldowns are mutex-guarded for multi-player safety.
- **Async teleport handling** — 30-second grace period after teleports to prevent false "abandoned" detection.
- **InstanceScript neutralization** — All boss encounters are marked DONE on populate to prevent native scripts from interfering.
- **Debuff purging** — Lingering debuffs from despawned creatures are removed before each floor.
- **Custom creature AI** — Trash creatures use `DungeonMasterCreatureAI` which patrols a 5 yd radius around spawn points, actively scans for players within aggro range (with a 1-second fallback timer for grid edge cases), and hooks `JustDied` for proper loot timing. Bosses retain their native ScriptName AI with all original spells and combat mechanics intact.
- **Boss spell damage scaling** — Boss abilities have hard-coded damage values designed for their original level range. The unit script intercepts all incoming damage from session bosses (spells, periodic ticks, and melee) and scales it using `creature_classlevelstats` base damage ratios between the boss's template level and the session's effective level. This ensures a level-70 boss spell deals proportionally correct damage to a level-25 party.
- **Multi-phase boss detection** — When a boss dies, the system waits 5 seconds and scans for new elite/boss creatures near the death location. If a phase-2 creature is detected, it is automatically promoted to boss status and the original death does not count as a kill.
- **Group Loot support** — Creature loot triggers the group's Need/Greed roll system for items above the group's loot quality threshold.
- **Boss damage scaling** — Boss damage uses only party-size scaling (not stacked with the difficulty tier's DamageMultiplier) to prevent excessive damage when combined with level scaling.
- **Standard AzerothCore** — All queries use standard AzerothCore column names. No fork-specific dependencies.
