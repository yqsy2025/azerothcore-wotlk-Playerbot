Thank you for contributing to mod-playerbots, please make sure that you...
1. Submit your PR to the test-staging branch, not master.
2. Read the guidelines below before submitting.
3. Don't delete parts of this template.

DESIGN PHILOSOPHY: We prioritize STABILITY, PERFORMANCE, AND PREDICTABILITY over behavioral realism.

Every action and decision executes PER BOT AND PER TRIGGER. Small increases in logic complexity scale
poorly across thousands of bots and negatively affect all. We prioritize a stable system over a smarter
one. Bots don't need to behave perfectly; believable behavior is the goal, not human simulation.
Default behavior must be cheap in processing; expensive behavior must be opt-in.

Before submitting, make sure your changes aligns with these principles.

## Pull Request Description
<!-- Describe what this change does and why it is needed -->



## Feature Evaluation
<!--
If your PR is very minimal (comment typo, wrong ID reference, etc), and it is very obvious it will not have
any impact on performance, you may skip these question. If necessary, a maintainer may ask you for them later.
-->

<!-- Please answer the following: -->
- Describe the **minimum logic** required to achieve the intended behavior.
- Describe the **processing cost** when this logic executes across many bots.



## How to Test the Changes
<!--
- Step-by-step instructions to test the change.
- Any required setup (e.g. multiple players, number of bots, specific configuration).
- Expected behavior and how to verify it.
-->



## Impact Assessment
<!-- As a generic test, before and after measure of pmon (playerbot pmon tick) can help you here. -->

    - [ ] No, not at all
    - [ ] Minimal impact (**explain below**)
    - [ ] Moderate impact (**explain below**)

    - [ ] No
    - [ ] Yes (**explain below**)



## Messages to Translate
<!--
Bot messages have to be translatable, but you don't need to do the translations here. You only need to make sure
the message is in a translatable format, and list in the table the message_key and the default English message.
Search for GetBotTextOrDefault in the codebase for examples.
